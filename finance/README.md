 **DISCLAIMER**: AJ Finance does NOT use current stock prices (I have a feeling that would be illegal). The API is set back a few months but the stock prices/your investments are updated consistently and in real time.

 AJ Finance is a full-stack web application made for the purpose of simulating stock trading. Once you have registered and logged in, you can buy shares, sell your investments, query for a stock price, and view your transaction history and portfolio. You are given $10,000 in fake money and the freedom to invest into any stock. You can see your investments grow/diminish in your portfolio.
