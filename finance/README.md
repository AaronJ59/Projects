### <ins>Description<ins>

**Technologies Used**: Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, 

AJ Finance is a full-stack web application made for the purpose of simulating stock trading. Once you have registered and logged in, you can buy shares, sell your investments, query for a stock price, and view your transaction history and portfolio. You are given $10,000 in fake money and the freedom to invest into any stock. You can see your investments grow/diminish in your portfolio.

 
### <ins>Disclaimers<ins>

* AJ Finance does NOT use current stock prices (I have a feeling that would be illegal). The API is set back a few months but the stock prices/your investments are updated consistently and in real time.
* All the functions in **helpers.py** were provided by the CS50x course


### <ins>Lessons Learned<ins>
* Grew comfortable with querying into an SQL database for specific information.
* Learned how to create a dynamic web application that handles HTTP requests from users and properly display information using Jinja.
